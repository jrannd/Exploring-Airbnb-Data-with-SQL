Air bnb SQL code

–We want to count the number of null values in columns we are particularly interested that could –help us find insights (accommodates, price, city, property type, etc) 

select sum(case when city is null then 1 else 0 end) AS number_of_nulls
     , count(city) AS count_not_nulls 
  from airbnb;
–distirict has  1,213,342 Null values

–Looking to see why there are so many Nulls
SELECT COUNT(district),district
FROM airbnb
GROUP BY district

–Looks like the column is only related to New York property listings (the 5 burrows of NY)
–bedrooms has  147,149 null, around 11% are null 85% are good to go, useable column 

–Add a new column to create a standardized unit of measure for price

ALTER TABLE airbnb
ADD price_in_usd numeric

–We want to standardize pricing of all listings so we turn them all into USD and create a column to store the new usd price

INSERT INTO airbnb (city,price,price_in_usd)
SELECT city,price,
CASE
		WHEN city = 'Sydney' THEN (price*0.667)
		WHEN city = 'Rome' THEN (price*1.03)
		WHEN city = 'Hong Kong' THEN (price*0.13)
		WHEN city = 'Bangkok' THEN (price*0.028)
		WHEN city = 'Cape Town' THEN (price*0.058)

		WHEN city = 'Mexico City' THEN (price*0.051)
		WHEN city = 'Paris' THEN (price*1.03)
		WHEN city = ‘New York’ THEN (price*1)
